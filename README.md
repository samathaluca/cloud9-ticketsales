# README.md 
Milestone project 1, featuring _The Who_.

## The Who Website/Ticket sales
This milestone project features the 55 year long career of the  rock band _The Who_. 
_The Who_ became the voice of a generation of angry young men. 
Their on stage athletics and smashing of instruments swelled their fan base.



Their music still features in many aspect of culture.
In the sixties and seventies _The Who_ wrote the film soundtrack to TOMMY. TOMMY evolved in to the film QUADROPHENIA. Violence and child abuse were aired. 
The Who’s TOMMY was turned in to a  multi-award winning epic rock musical.
_The Who_.  tracks became theme tunes for the popular CSI crime series.

After seeing them in concert myself last year at Manchester Arena, I appreciated why they are a rock legend. I was a guest and did not consider myself a fan, I was pleasantly surprised. The band's command of the stage and the audience were impressive and infectious. With front row tickets at Wembley, London costing up to £8,100 _The Who_ are still in demand enough to justify their average £75 ticket price. 
Roger Daltry's lead vocals are still powerful in 2019. The band exude energy, commitment to their performances and do not disappoint despite the original band members being 70 years old. 


Their main website is a busy, high energy, overly commercial site. I have put together a pared down, simple version of a site for ambience and history versus commercialism yet. The aim was a more simple offering of tour information and links for ticket sales.  



## UX
**_The strategy plane:_**.
The aim is to create a website that is not as over stimulating and commercialised as _The Who_'s official site. 

The simplicity and speed of use of the site navigation has in mind the older fans who would like to revisit their youth and enjoy their memories but have limited attention span for searching on line. 
It was designed with a mobile first approach plus a familiar feel for younger people who may only know the tunes from computer game, advertising or TV series theme tunes. 
These users both enjoy retro culture and live music.

**The business goals** of this website are:
To promote the band. In particular to promote concert ticket sales.
As bands now make less money from record sales than ever before , their concert ticket sales are crucial to them. 

Making it easy to buy tickets on impulse is key. 
I included the option to buy tickets in each of the currencies included on the tour. This should give confidence and would stop the barrier of currency exchange concerns. 
The buy tickets section can either be scrolled to or reached instantly using the navigation bar links.

I have opted to use the major ticket selling sites because buying from each separate arena's website can distract the user with adverts for other events or sellout dates and potentially lose sales.

When linking to a few examples of the venues, I have ensured that the user will link directly on the relevant page to keep focus on The Who.

Links to social media have been added but positioned after the opportunity to buy tickets and with relatively small icons to encourage the user to stay on the site as long as possible. 
I also positioned the icons in the bottom left on larger screens considering it looked OK but kept the 'home' link as the most visible option. 

The site needs to go live before the start of the tour to ensure all venues are still available.

Gathering details via the contact page will help promote future tours and be an indication of how the site has captured the interest of the users.


**The customer goals** 


As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need efficiently.
As a new visitor to the website, I want view this artist's gallery, and view their work in detail so I can decide if I want to commission their work.
As a new visitor to the website, I want learn more about the artist, so I can feel I connect with her as a person.
As a potential client, I want to know what past clients thought of their artwork and the service they received.
As a potential client, I want to view expected prices for a portrait, so I can decide if it is within my budget to order.
As an interested client, I want to understand the ordering process, so I know what steps to take next.
As an interested client, I want an easy to fill in contact form, so I can make contact with the artist and place my order.
As an interested observer and/or potential client, I want to follow the artist on social media, so I can keep up with her latest news.
As a returning visitor to the website, who has already decided to contact the artist, I want to be able to find the request a quote page easily.
Wireframe mockups:








As a user, I want to be sufficiently engaged so that I am motivated to perform  action, so that I can achieve a goal.

The users will be fans of the who or potential fans wanting to be reassured that the band is still relevant today. 
Users need to be reassured not only by the band's  past massive success but also their current credibility as performers in spite of the band members ages.

Older users may wish to reminisce enjoying the youthful thrill of the times.

Users should feel good about supporting musicians and song writers in their endeavours so that they remain motivated to tour and make new music for us to enjoy.
The customer goals of this website are:


Intuitive ordering process.
As a user I may know that _The Who_'s music has endured for decades because they are good song writers but what is making them still relevant today. 


I would search for this by viewing recent video and images.

User know they like listening to the music but would buying a concert ticket be a sound purchase or a disappointment. 
I may want some evidence.
The high quality iframe full concert was aimed at fans who are considering booking tickets for the tour but need to know that the band still exude passion, energy and enthusiasm. 
I want to know that the band is not jaded and lost passion the first sign of this will be outdated information. 

As directed by module 4 of the course, I had in the back of my mind the knowledge that users will be thinking, at all times, even if it is at a
subliminal level, "Do I like being in here?", "Is it a place I want to return to?". 

“A picture paints a thousand words” is often used in marketing to illustrate the need for good images to sell a product. I read that an image can communicate instantly, as our brain can interpret them much quicker than text.
I have used swift links and transitions because I prefer them and I believe that the generation of fans for whom the site will be most relevant may not have cutting edge technology and hardware to 
view the site. 
As a user I will expect to see social media links 
As an interested observer and/or potential client, I want to follow the artist on social media, so I can keep up with her latest news.

I want to understand the ordering process, so I know what steps to take next.
As a user , I want an easy to fill in contact form without a password, so I can make contact with the artist and place my order.

As a returning visitor to the website,  I want to be able to buy tickets again knowing I will not be phished or take a long time booking.

Wireframe mockups:


**_ scope plane:_**.
Based on information from the strategy plane, a full concert video from their last tour demonstrates that the lead singer still has power in his voice and live events will not be a disappointment.
The images have been chosen to create a positive emotional response and fond memories or a sense of retro ambience for a modern appeal. In addition the most recent concert images are included.

Audio clips easily available aim to stop the user leaving the site before a potential ticket purchase.
A simple ticket purchasing process within the body of one page , with minimal decision making makes impulse and intuitive buying an option. minimal clicks and the target blank feature mean that if tickets are not available at a particular venue or dates needed, the user can go back on the site and chose again easily.
A contact form to provide future tour details and fan news is included.
Other users may need to be persuaded by images and videos before they believe it is worth spending the money.
The user can navigate by rapid scrolling or swift links.

**_ structure plane:_**
The call to action tour and ticket section is placed first in the navigation bar but further down in the body of the site  . 

The thinking being that users may simply want to buy a ticket, using the navigation bar to get there immediately. 

Other users may need to be persuaded by images and videos before they believe it is worth spending the money.

The structure chosen was to present a simple flow of what users will expect to see on any band website.

The social media at the end will mean that users are not distracted and lead away immediately. 


**_ skeleton plane:_**
The skeleton will be a one page site with different sections . The sections will be 

- About
- Buy Tickets
- Famous tracks
- Gallery 
- Contact.

The user can navigate by rapid scrolling or swift links.

I started development of a 5 page site but then decided that there would be limited advantage to a multiple page design with a relatively small amount of content. 

One page captured all the main content is different sections.

I have used swift links and transitions because I prefer them and I believe that the generation of fans for whom the site will be most relevant may not have cutting edge technology and hardware to 
view the site. 
This is an assumption which would be adapted quickly after the site goes live and e.g. google analytics evidence that users are leaving the site quickly and contact form has minimal response. 

**_ surface plane:_**

The black and white images evoke the sense of the band's longevity and pedigree. The colour lifted the site giving it dimension and modernity. 

Fonts used are easy to read, up to date choices.
The surface layout is in line with what is currently comfortable, easily absorbed and familiar to users.

### Mockups
At the outset, I intended to complete a design with a 5 page payout. Please find the paper and pen mockup with crossing outs as amendments when I changed my mind while coding the multiple page site.
As the design evolved and with guidance from my mentor, I opted for a one page design.
Please find the latest pen and paper design in mockup file.

- -(started balsamiq design but not sure there is an advantage as paper and pen designs help clarify thoughts more for me)

## Features

### Existing Features
-- Bootstrap navbar linking to each section of the site.
The one page project has a section focusing on
_Home_
_About_
_Buy Tickets_
_Famous tracks (audio clips)_
_gallery_
_contact_

#### Home
Eye catching front page with simple strap line contained within a bootstrap jumbotron.
To keep interest and encourage scrolling down there is a carousel with iconic pictures of the band's signature moments. 
The Who were famous for the antics on stage. Particularly Pete Townsend 's jumps with his guitar. Plus the band famously smashed up instruments on stage appealing to the sixties 
mood.
The landing page carousel of atmospheric pictures will hopefully appeal to live music fans. Capturing the moments the band is most famous for will hopefully be appreciated by lovers of festivals.
The hope being that the carousel gain interest by including grainy original pictures. Instead of changing the vertical height of the third picture I left it raw on smaller screens so that the lack of repetition would renew interest.
On larger screens the different height was too much so I set the height of each image to match.
Black and white theme chosen because of 1960s history.
I did try both the sixties and the later bullseye logo on the nav bar but the look of simplistic original version appeared more in keeping. 

#### About
Information page.
Iframe containing full colour video of complete half of 2018 concert is set under the black and white images. Alongside is information text explaining the history.
An auto start for the video was considered but research revealed that is can be intrusive and so has not proved favourable. 
An unexpected start to an audio or video clip can be annoying, especially when users could be searching at work or in school or in company. 
Attention was given to the quality of the video. The ending is a bit random with Indian music added but the choice of Indian music is gentle and pleasant and not an unpleasant finish.
High quality video should give fans confidence that the concert are still a positive experience without any risk of disappointment. the band members are older and may not look as cool but their voices are powerful.
There are two dead original band members and I did think about honouring them and promoting the new line up but as this is not a positive message and new band members can be transient and so outdate the site quickly,
I focuced on the core members who are still going strong with voices and energy that is still impressive.
The text informaton content is a supportive gesture mantaining focus on the live concert video.
    
#### Buy Tickets
Tour dates 
- Ticket buying
    - buy tickets next to the tour dates of the band so that people can go straight from the website and not look it up separately
    - for the venues rather than independent ticket buying sites, I have ensures the link goes directly to the relevant page so that the 
    - user does not get frustrated or distracted trying to navigate the site. So minimising the effors and click numbers to paying the money.
e.g. ticket buying links but the standard blue matches the red blue and white flag and tour themes plus the who bulleste logo. 
gallery collage was a sixites and seventies thiung stil
ured the collage style popular in the band's hayday for the most part in the gallery. 
i have not changed things just to prove i can do it forexample i can eaisilty change image sixer and font colour
 e.g. ticket buying links but the standard blue matches the red blue and white flag and tour themes plus the who bulleste logo. 
gallery c

#### Famous Tracks
Background is kept simple as the appearance with a background image or wallpaper was not as attractive within the overall site. It was noted that the audio controls loaded with purple spot colour in 
Internet explorer browser. With the simple background this looked attractive and the functionality remained in tact so no html or css amendments were made to alter this.
The famous tracks section includes. 
- 6 Audio song clips. Using audio control to play popular songs in mp3 format. Allows users to listen to popular songs by the band from within the site. 
- 6 audio clips were chosen for their small file size, variety of styles and familiarity. Plus they are slightly different from other tracks which are at the forefront of social media.

#### Gallery 
The poster image at the top of the gallery was intended to convey youthful prowess. Marketing often concludes that images of attractive faces are what users react to. 
The image of heady days was initally chosen before I decided which type of gallery most suited the site. With extensive experimentation, I eventually favoured the collage style popular in the band's hayday.
the woman's legs on pete townsend are deliberate for humour and never taking themselves too seriously 

- Photo gallery
- Allows users to view photos of the band members and their characters. There is a collage of old and new photos. Monochrome and colour pictures have been blended for interesting contrast.  
- The background image attempts to convey the influence and popularity of the band in the sixties. Woodstock was a historic music event which rippled through the world, 
possibly giving rise to the popularity of festivals today. The background image is a picture of the crowd at woodstock.
- The poster image at the top of the gallery is resized for different screen sizes. Media queries removed the outsized image responsively.
- Recent 2018 images live in action on stage at new year 2019 would hopefully create interest in seeing the band live on tour this year. 

#### Contact
- Contact form
    - Contact form for users interested in receiving future tour information and fan club information. 
    - Required input field for email and small text field for short message. 
    - submit button will advise the user if they have inputted the password incorrectly. 


#### Footer 
Home Link to the home part of the page.
Social media link via font awesome icons.

## Reference
- As a complete beginner to coding I need to read , watch and listen to a wealth of additional resources.
- These included
- 1. Get coding published by Walker supported by Young rewired state.
- 2. Learn CSS in one day and learn it well by Jamie Chan
- 3. The smart way to learn html and CSS by MArk Myers
- 4. Audiobook Programming for beginners : 6 books in one including CSS HTML and Javascript
- 5. I used w3schools extensively. Quizzes, exercises and lessons.
- 6. Tutors and Mentors at CI. repeated coursework, quizzes a number of times.
- 7. I watched numerous tutorials on youtube. 
- 8. Slack and Stack.

## Testing
HTML and CSS validators were used througout development. The validators I used were https://validator.w3.org/.
 Each time I was happy with the functionality of a section I checked the code .
 tested repeatedly using developer tools and in different browsers. sometimes the difference in presentation was attractive enough not to necessitate change. for example the audio controls are very different between browsers but still look good and function well. 
 I put forward my code to be tested in a slack online call session where the lead student pointed out various mistakes in the responsive design that I had not picked up in developer tools. 
 I posted my code for peer review in slack . I asked lead students, tutors and mentors to check the code for anything clearly out of sync. My mentor picked up an error in the console of dev tools which showed an image was not loading . I commented out the background image that was redundant in the design.
 My final html validator result showed two errors. One for the iframe width which uses a % rather than px or em. I did not want to change it because it was working and resizing in different screens so well. The response from other students in slack and CI tutor was that
 width % is acceptable so I left it.
 The only other error shown by the validator in the final code that I did not correct was the link listing the different fonts I had used. I looked online for the solution to combining the fonts in to one url link. I then asked in slack. Both came up with the same solution which worked. That is |between fonts. 
 All CSS errors were corrected.

## Version control
 I started the project in a separate workspace planning originally to have separate pages for each section. As I progressed the project evovoled in to one page with links and scrolling functions
 The original workplace was https://ide.c9.io/samgore/who-milestone. 4 Git commits.
 The finished project git commits were simply named at first because there was so much work to be done they were never going to be a reference unless all the work was lost. As the development becAME MORE PRODUCTIVE i BEGAN NAMING THE COMMITS WITH GREATER SPECIFICITY. 
 
 Content
The text for 
the about section was copied from the Wikipedia article about the Who.
Media
Video was obtained from youtube.com
The photos used in this site were obtained from google images.
Audio clips used were provided by ......... spotify 
Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project by searching the world's 25 best band websites. 
I like the black and white carousel and mood of the Alice in Chains site by Vandalay productions which evolved in to colour. 
I thought that fitted with the fact that the who launched their career when black and white TV was available.

Features Left to Implement

Version control
The project focus changed as follows.
I began the project with the focus being the band Herman and the Hermits. 
I then decided to develop my project outside the band brief, I discussed ideas with my mentor to ensure the scope 
would be similar to that of the example band brief. 
As my project outside the brief developed I was struggling to develop the asset and social media contact alongside development.
I then decided I would concentrate on the coding skills imporvement rather than the site content.
Research showed an adundance of readily available assets and social media presence for **_THE WHO_**. 
I set out and wrote mockups for a 5 page site . 
As I experimented with the responsive mobile first, approach I considered that a one page site could feature all the essential elements.
I was undecided when I began developing the one page site so left the original workspace in tact in case I wanted to return to it. 
For this reason early development is in a number of git repositories.

Early work -
https://github.com/samathaluca/milestone1.git (5 Commits)
https://github.com/samathaluca/project2.git   (3 Commits)
https://github.com/samathaluca/who.git    (2 Commits)

I did not grasp how important evidence of version control was at the outset. I also only realised how important the commit message was recently.
Please can the number of early commits be considered. Also please consider that the error made in the lack of specificity spplied to the git  commit messages 
( plus error duplicate commit number 6) in usable workplace be considered part of the learning process which I will now ensure 
is rectified in the future. 



#### contact
- Contact form
    - Contact form for users interested in receiving future tour information and fan club information. 
    - Required input field for email and small text field for short message.

 HTML and CSS validators were used througout development. The validators I used for both css and html were https://validator.w3.org/. Being unfamiliar previously with markdown I used https://markdownlivepreview.com/ . This was a useful spellcheck for my readme.
 Each time I was happy with the functionality of a section I checked the code .

## Version control

I began the project with the focus being the band Herman and the Hermits. I chose Herman and the hermits because a childhood friend toured as a substitute for the band as keyboard player.
As the project did not take shape I abandoned it early on, deciding instead to develop my project outside the CI brief. 
I discussed ideas with my mentor to ensure the scope would be similar to that required in the band project brief. 
As my project began to take shape I was struggling to develop the asset and social media content alongside my milestone project.
I then decided that I would concentrate on learning coding skills rather than being distracted by asset development.
Research showed an adundance of readily available assets and social media presence for **_THE WHO_**. Having been to a very recent concert despite not considering myself a fan previously,
I became enthusiatic about the topic and wrote a pen and paper mockup for a 5 page site. 
As I experimented with the responsive mobile first approach, I began to consider that a one page site could feature all the essential elements.
I was undecided when I began developing the one page site so left the original workspace in tact in case I wanted to return to it. 
For this reason early development is in a number of git repositories.
I was told by tutors that if coding a project has really taken a wrong turn , it is better to start fresh than try salvage poorly structured code.
For this reason I did start fresh with the knowledge of my early mistakes. My initial coding fumblings are in the following repositories. 
Early work -
https://github.com/samathaluca/milestone1.git (5 Commits)
https://github.com/samathaluca/project2.git   (3 Commits)
https://github.com/samathaluca/who.git    (2 Commits). 

Unfortunatley, I did not grasp how important evidence of version control was at the outset. Furthermore, I also only realised how important the commit message was recently.
The early different versions were named in numerical order . As the development felt more productive, I began naming the commits with greater specificity. 
Please can the number of early commits in relevant repositories be considered? Also please consider that the errors made in the lack of specificity applied to the git  commit messages 
( plus error duplicate commit number 6) was part of the learning process which I am now aware of and will rectify in the future. 
My early commits show that I had no understanding of how to beautify code or it's importance generally.

I now grasp fully how imperative the number of git commits, the commit message and beautiying code is. 

The original workplace was https://ide.c9.io/samgore/who-milestone. 4 Git commits.





********** The final project workspace is 

# Find out our current directory
pwd

# List the contents of the directory
ls

# Create a new local git repository
git init

# Check for the existence of the `.git` directory
ls -a

# Add the `css` directory and each of the `.html` files to
# the git staging area
git add css/ stream-*.html

# Check the git status to double-check that they've been
# added
git status

# Do our first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/aaroncistudent/my-first-website.git

# Push from our local repository to the remote
git push -u origin master



also www3 templates made me tackle from blank sheet. Lathough i did not eventually use anything from the template it got something working in my ide.
